# quickly javascript game #

<p>It is my first game wrote in javascript
I know, advanced programmers would hang dogs on me, for this ugly code, reason of this spaghetti code is that time I didn't know much about programming in JavaScript.
This <a href="https://quicklygame.onrender.com/#board4" target="blank"> GAME QUICKLY </a> 
is just an exercise
  <span style="color:green;">
    Yes, I know it could be written much better
